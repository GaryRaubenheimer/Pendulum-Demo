The Pendulum Demo project explores the motion of single and double pendulums. 
While single pendulums exhibit predictable behavior, double pendulums showcase chaotic, sensitive motion and instability.

This project was created to learn Pygame, Visual Studio Code, and version control with Git and GitHub, 
while combining my interest in physics and programming. It demonstrates my ability to build interactive applications
