# Pendulum Demo - Cursor Enhancement Project

## Overview
The Pendulum Demo project explores the motion of single and double pendulums through interactive physics simulation. While single pendulums exhibit predictable behavior, double pendulums showcase chaotic, sensitive motion and instability.

## Project Evolution
This project has evolved through multiple learning phases:

**Original Purpose**: Created to learn Pygame, Visual Studio Code, and version control with Git and GitHub, while combining physics and programming interests.

**Current Purpose**: This cloned repository serves as a learning platform for **Cursor AI-powered development** and comprehensive codebase improvement. We're using AI assistance to analyze, refactor, and enhance the existing pendulum simulation.

## Enhancement Roadmap
We've conducted a comprehensive analysis of the codebase across multiple dimensions:
- **Architecture**: Identifying circular dependencies, global state issues, and design pattern opportunities
- **Features**: Documenting missing functionality and incomplete implementations  
- **Code Quality**: Addressing naming conventions, documentation, and readability
- **Performance**: Optimizing rendering, physics calculations, and memory usage
- **Tool Integration**: Improving pygame usage and development workflow

ðŸ“‹ **See [`cursor_TODO.md`](cursor_TODO.md)** for the complete analysis and improvement roadmap.

## Learning Goals
- Master Cursor's AI-powered development capabilities
- Transform a working prototype into production-quality code
- Apply modern software engineering practices to a physics simulation
- Demonstrate iterative improvement through AI-assisted development

## Features
- Interactive single and double pendulum simulations
